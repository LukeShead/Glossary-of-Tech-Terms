## What are SCRUMS?

First thing you need to know is that scrum is not an acronym. SCRUM is a term derived from Rugby, Scrum in rugby is the act of all players working together to succeed at their task at collecting the ball and pushing the other team back. Scrumming a project in IT business is not much different except instead of physically overthrowing your opponents with your team, you overthrow and solve problems with a team. Each person helps out with all the work that people have to allow projects to be finished quicker and with more efficiency.

## There are some key tech terms that must be known when completing projects, here are 10 of them for you now:

### 1: Sprint- 
When a scrum project has a sprint, it means that the project has a time limit of less than 30 days, projects usually have sprints when the customer has ordered an item that has to be developed, for example if the customer wants a website with certain functions. A sprint means that the project can be completed in time, most projects in the workplace will be sprinted for efficiency. 

### 2. Sprint backlog- 
The sprint backlog is the information that the team uses to look at the development of the project in order to receive the 'Sprint goal', it is usually the work needed to be able to present the correct functions to the customer. The backlog is used to help the team understand what they need to do and use before it is finished.

### 3. Motivational theories- These are theories that exist to motivate team members into completing projects faster and more effeciently, some examples are:

#### The Hierarcy of needs: 
This is the theory that people will have certain priorities based on what level they want to work, put down to basic survival the analogy is if someone is stranded in the forest, people will first aim for basic survival, however once people have had basic survival close to mastered, they will look to improve on their condition with shelter or simialar things. This is the same in the workplace and people that have recently joined a company will be looking at a basic survival on doing tasks whereas others who have worked for a longer period of time will want to achieve the next level, therefore giving them more complex jobs might prove useful.

#### Carrot and stick:
This is the theory that workers are motivated on two things, incentives and fear, these two factors are the source for motivation in people, for example a person that is motivated by incentives, it could be climbing the ladder, or having better pay as well as wanting more luxeries in life. All of these would motivate someone as they could look at somethings that they would enjoy having and work towards them. However motivated by fear is where someone is motivated out of fear of losing their job, losing certain luxeries in life or just the dissapointment of being a failure, these may sound very horrible but it is what people are motivated by according to this theory.

#### Motivation-Hygiene Theory
This is the theory that there is either satisfaction or dissatisfaction within a work enviroment, with satisfaction being within achievement or forms of advancement within the workplace that could include salary rise or more important roles. However the dissatisfaction can be included within work conditions, salary and also relationships with peers. According to the theory, these factors must be managed effectivley in order to motivate the employees correctly. It is the employers job to manage these factors if they want the business to be successful.

### 4. Velocity- 
It is often used in projects to keep track on how well the team is doing and how the team is progressing in comparison to the time frame that the project has, this will usually be kept track by the scrum master.

### 5. Algorythm- 
An algorithm or procedure is a set of instructions to for the computer to run and follow, i when using coding, the algorithm is what tells the computer the steps to take to to reach the end goal of the program. There are inputs that are called ingredients, and there are outputs called results. The ingredients are what the designer inputs, the results are what the program outputs, all of this is needed to successfully build an application.

### 6. Program Paradigms- 
A paradigm is way to classify what type of features a programming language has, there are 3 main paradigms. Procedural, Event Driven and Object oriented programming. The procedural type of programming is where the program runs on its own without any input, this means that once started, the program will not change what it is doing, until it finishes its task. Object oriented is programs that are based around objects and have interactions with those in order to comeplete its task. The last is the Event driven programmming, this is the form of programming that will constantly look for some form of input from the user, for example an input of a mouse click, or key press.

Each paragrims have unique properties to them, because of this it means that projects are best suited being classified towards a certain one, for example if a game is to be built, it will be event driven as it requires inputs. Because of this, the 3 paragrims are always being used, the three are not better than each other it is purely down the type of application that is being built.

### 7. Product backlog- 
This is the list of jobs that the team have to complete in order to complete the project, this is run by the product owner and it helps the product design stages go smoothly.

### 8. Burn up chart- 
This is a chart that shows the amount of work that is currently being completed throughout the project, this can be used to show the efficiency of the team and show where the weak and strong points are in a team such as the amount of hours worked.

### 9. Steps from writing to execution-

1. A planning step, this usually includes a flowchart and will show how the project will pan out and how it will function.

2. This is where all of the functions are planned, whatever they are, their use will be used within the project so it is important to get the functions planned properly by the end of this step. This is where the flowchart comes into use the most as it outlines the functions the best.

3. After everything has been planned, it's then the step of implementing the functions and algorythm into the project, this step will follow the flowchart in how it is built, following the steps in order to make it work properly. However, this step can be very different depending on the type of software development model the team have chosen.

4. After it is all built and tested it is but into a compilier that will convert it to a low-level language that can make it easier for the system to run.

5. There is a link tool that is used to take all the parts of the code and link them all for execution.

6. The program executes after being loaded into the memory by the loader.

### 10. Scrum Team- 
This may be simple, but it is the most important part of a scrum, this is the team that will complete this project, this will involve the whole team and everyone will have their own jobs within the project that they can all trust each other to complete and work together to finish the project on time, all of this means that the projects can be successful and the customer can be satisfied.
