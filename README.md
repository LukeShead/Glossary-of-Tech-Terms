## What are SCRUMS?

First thing you need to know is that scrum is not an acronym. SCRUM is a term derived from Rugby, Scrum in rugby is the act of all players working together to succeed at their task at collecting the ball and pushing the other team back. Scrumming a project in IT business is not much different except instead of physically overthrowing your opponents with your team, you overthrow and solve problems with a team. Each person helps out with all the work that people have to allow projects to be finished quicker and with more efficiency.

## There are some key tech terms that must be known when completing projects, here are 10 of them for you now:

### 1: Sprint- 
When a scrum project has a sprint, it means that the project has a time limit of less than 30 days, projects usually have sprints when the customer has ordered an item that has to be developed, for example if the customer wants a website with certain functions. A sprint means that the project can be completed in time, most projects in the workplace will be sprinted for efficiency. 

### 2. Sprint backlog- 
The sprint backlog is the information that the team uses to look at the development of the project in order to receive the 'Sprint goal', it is usually the work needed to be able to present the correct functions to the customer. The backlog is used to help the team understand what they need to do and use before it is finished.

### 3. Motivational theories- These are theories that exist to motivate team members into completing projects faster and more effeciently, some examples are:

#### The Hierarcy of needs: 
This is the theory that people will have certain priorities based on what level they want to work, put down to basic survival the analogy is if someone is stranded in the forest, people will first aim for basic survival, however once people have had basic survival close to mastered, they will look to improve on their condition with shelter or simialar things. This is the same in the workplace and people that have recently joined a company will be looking at a basic survival on doing tasks whereas others who have worked for a longer period of time will want to achieve the next level, therefore giving them more complex jobs might prove useful.

#### Carrot and stick:
This is the theory that workers are motivated on two things, incentives and fear, these two factors are the source for motivation in people, for example a person that is motivated by incentives, it could be climbing the ladder, or having better pay as well as wanting more luxeries in life. All of these would motivate someone as they could look at somethings that they would enjoy having and work towards them. However motivated by fear is where someone is motivated out of fear of losing their job, losing certain luxeries in life or just the dissapointment of being a failure, these may sound very horrible but it is what people are motivated by according to this theory.

#### Motivation-Hygiene Theory
This is the theory that there is either satisfaction or dissatisfaction within a work enviroment, with satisfaction being within achievement or forms of advancement within the workplace that could include salary rise or more important roles. However the dissatisfaction can be included within work conditions, salary and also relationships with peers. According to the theory, these factors must be managed effectivley in order to motivate the employees correctly. It is the employers job to manage these factors if they want the business to be successful.

### 4. Velocity- 
It is often used in projects to keep track on how well the team is doing and how the team is progressing in comparison to the time frame that the project has, this will usually be kept track by the scrum master.

### 5. Algorithm- 
An algorithm or procedure is a set of instructions to for the computer to run and follow, I when using coding, the algorithm is what tells the computer the steps to take to to reach the end goal of the program. There are inputs that are called ingredients, and there are outputs called results. The ingredients are what the designer inputs, the results are what the program outputs, all of this is needed to successfully build an application.

#### The algorithm/steps of building an application

The steps of building an application usually follow the same algorithm, 

##### Planning

The first step is usually planning, this is where the creator or team will come together to get an idea or problem, by first finding these it means that the project will have a clear direction in the development stage. Along with getting the idea it will also be the application itself and how it will function, for example flowcharts may be made in order for a team to fully understand how the app will function and what steps it will need to follow. This will usually take the most amount of time in the whole application build process as it is where many of the functions must be looked at, as well as some being added and removed based on how helpful they are to the application.

The second step is the requirements stage, this is where the team will look at the target market, the cost, scope, resources and many more factors in order to determine what is needed to complete the project, this will usually be the starting point that will cover whether the project is feasible or not. This stage is to make sure the team know everything they have and need to get before the project can be started. This step is important as without it there can be complications with the project that will hinder the project being completed whilst it is in it's development stage. 

The third step is the development process, this is where the creator or team will start to build the algorithm for the application, this can start in many ways and can use many different forms of methods to help the developers build it easier. It will usually start with prototypes of the application and depending on the development model that the developers are using, they will continue with the next part of the developing process. If they are following a model like waterfall then they will probably continue to develop the first part of the application before moving on, however if they are following a RAD model they will most likely prototype the application again. This step can be done in many ways and it will differ depending on the team and the skills they posess.

The fourth step is the testing step, this can be started as the application is almost finished, or it can be done as it is just starting development, however it is done, it is about debugging the application and making sure any errors that are made are looked at and are dealt with before the application is finished. Some teams will test and debug as the application is being build between each stage of the development process whereas others will use the time at the end of the development process to debug it all at once. However it is done it is the most important part once the development is complete as this is making sure that the application works properly and stops any bugs from ruining the application for the users.

The final step is the review step, this is where the project is reviewed for how it is completed, it will be looked at and analysed for all of it's features and given a review on how it peforms. This is where the reputation of the game comes from and depending on how the reviews go, will depend on how many people will view the project. For example, if there isn't a good review and it is shown to still have bugs that got past the testing stage, it will mean that the project will have problems with it's functionality and as of such not be favoured when compared to other projects with similar functionalities.


If these steps are done properly the application that is built will be much more successful than if one of these steps were rushed. 

### 6. Program Paradigms- 

A paradigm is way to classify what type of features a programming language has, there are 3 main paradigms. Procedural, Event Driven and Object oriented programming.

#### Procedural
The procedural type of programming is where the program runs on its own without any input, this means that once started, the program will not change what it is doing, until it finishes its task. This usually is used for an application that runs in the background of systems or has specific tasks that cannot be changed without hindering something else. For example an anti-malware system can provide protection to a computer after it has been run and doesnt require any input from the user in order to keep checking for malware.

#### Object oriented
Object oriented is programs that are based around objects and have interactions with those in order to comeplete its task. This can be related to building a car, the object would be the car itself, the functions would be the components to build the car, for example the wheels of the car could be the number or interger value which would most likely return 4 for a standard car. The next component would be the car engine, this would be defined by an engine type and would give either deisel or petrol back to the user in order to show what it needs. With all the functions within the object of the car, the object known as car will be created, this object can now be altered and used to allow a program to run. 

#### Event driven
The last is the Event driven programmming, this is the form of programming that will constantly look for some form of input from the user, for example an input of a mouse click, or key press. These are programs that require some interactive features in order to be successful, this can include a game, quiz or just a general slide show that requries input to change slides. With this kind of program being the most common as it can keep the user more entertained than others. 

#### Relationships between them

When looking at all program paradigms all of the programs that these come under will all do some things the exact same, some examples of this are that they all give inputs and output, they all use variables, they all have forms of repitition within them, they all can have decisions within them and all of them use structures of data in order to function, this means that each one does the same thing when creating programs. This is where the relationship can come between them, as all of them can be used for the same things. One program can be built to do the same thing however depending on how it is built it can be all 3 of them. Lastly, the biggest relationship between paradigms is that they are all used for the same thing, every program that is made no matter what paradigm it is made from can be used to solve problems, as all program's functions are too solve problems that people have all of them have this relationship. 


### 7. Product backlog- 
This is the list of jobs that the team have to complete in order to complete the project, this is run by the product owner and it helps the product design stages go smoothly.

### 8. Burn up chart- 
This is a chart that shows the amount of work that is currently being completed throughout the project, this can be used to show the efficiency of the team and show where the weak and strong points are in a team such as the amount of hours worked.

### 9. Steps from writing to execution-

#### Idea
This is the step in which the problem is shown to the team whether it be from the team or from a client, the team will plan a solution to the problem and will make sure that all the problems are solved with it. The way to find the solution can be done through many methods such as system analysis.

#### Planning
This is the step in which the solution is looked

1. A planning step, this usually includes a flowchart and will show how the project will pan out and how it will function.

2. 

2. This is where all of the functions are planned, whatever they are, their use will be used within the project so it is important to get the functions planned properly by the end of this step. This is where the flowchart comes into use the most as it outlines the functions the best.

3. After everything has been planned, it's then the step of implementing the functions and algorythm into the project, this step will follow the flowchart in how it is built, following the steps in order to make it work properly. However, this step can be very different depending on the type of software development model the team have chosen.

4. After it is all built and tested it is but into a compilier that will convert it to a low-level language that can make it easier for the system to run.

5. There is a link tool that is used to take all the parts of the code and link them all for execution.

6. The program executes after being loaded into the memory by the loader.

### 10. Scrum Team- 
This may be simple, but it is the most important part of a scrum, this is the team that will complete this project, this will involve the whole team and everyone will have their own jobs within the project that they can all trust each other to complete and work together to finish the project on time, all of this means that the projects can be successful and the customer can be satisfied.
