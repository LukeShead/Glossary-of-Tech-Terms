## First off:

### What are SCRUMS?

#### First thing you need to know is that scrum is not an acronym. SCRUM is a term derived from Rugby, Scrum in rugby is the act of all players working together to succeed at their task at collecting the ball and pushing the other team back. Scrumming a project in IT business is not much different except instead of physically overthrowing your opponents with your team, you overthrow and solve problems with a team. Each person helps out with all the work that people have to allow projects to be finished quicker and with more efficiency.

### There are some key terms that must be known when Scrumming projects, here are 10 of them for you now:

#### 1: Sprint- When a scrum project has a sprint, it means that the project has a time limit of less than 30 days, projects usually have sprints when the customer has ordered an item that has to be developed, for example if the customer wants a website with certain functions. A sprint means that the project can be completed in time, most projects in the workplace will be sprinted for efficiency. 

#### 2. Sprint backlog- The sprint backlog is the information that the team uses to look at the development of the project in order to receive the 'Sprint goal', it is usually the work needed to be able to present the correct functions to the customer. The backlog is used to help the team understand what they need to do and use before it is finished.

#### 3. Sprint Goal- The sprint goal is simply put, the purpose of the sprint, itâ€™s the goal that the team are trying to achieve. The sprinted scrum project all works towards the sprint goal and it does not deviate from it.

#### 4. Velocity- It is often used in projects to keep track on how well the team is doing and how the team is progressing in comparison to the time frame that the project has, this will usually be kept track by the scrum master.

#### 5. Algorythm- An algorithm or procedure is a set of instructions to for the computer to run and follow, i when using coding, the algorithm is what tells the computer the steps to take to to reach the end goal of the program. There are inputs that are called ingredients, and there are outputs called results. By having these ingredients it is what builds an application, having the algorithm the application can be built successfully.

#### 6. Scrum Master- This is the person of the team that supervises the project, they will allocate jobs and host the meetings that take place, this person has the most amount of work to do as they have their own jobs as well as making sure other jobs are done also.

#### 7. Product backlog- This is the list of jobs that the team have to complete in order to complete the project, this is run by the product owner and it helps the product design stages go smoothly.

#### 8. Burn up chart- This is a chart that shows the amount of work that is currently being completed throughout the project, this can be used to show the efficiency of the team and show where the weak and strong points are in a team such as the amount of hours worked.

#### 9. Product owner- This is the role in the team that has the job of increasing and maximizing the value in an item, for example adding more functions or advertising using business.

#### 10. Scrum Team- This may be simple, but it is the most important part of a scrum, this is the team that will complete this project, this will involve the whole team and everyone will have their own jobs within the project that they can all trust each other to complete and work together to finish the project on time, all of this means that the projects can be successful and the customer can be satisfied.
