### What are SCRUMS?

#### First thing you need to know is that scrum is not an acronym. SCRUM is a term derived from Rugby, Scrum in rugby is the act of all players working together to succeed at their task at collecting the ball and pushing the other team back. Scrumming a project in IT businness is not much different except instead of physically overthrowing your opponents with your team, you overthrow and slove problems with a team.
